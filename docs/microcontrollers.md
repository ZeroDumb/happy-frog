## üîß Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Install CircuitPython

1. **Download CircuitPython Firmware**
   - Visit [circuitpython.org](https://circuitpython.org/)
   - Find your board in the list or go straight to [xiao rp2040](https://circuitpython.org/board/seeeduino_xiao_rp2040/)
   - Download the appropriate `.uf2` file


2. **Enter Bootloader Mode**
   - Connect your Xiao RP2040 via USB-C
   - Double-tap the reset button
   - The device should appear as a USB drive named `RPI-RP2`

3. **Flash CircuitPython**
   - Copy the downloaded `.uf2` file to the `RPI-RP2` drive
   - The device will automatically restart
   - You should now see a `CIRCUITPY` drive

4. **Verify Installation**
   - Open the `CIRCUITPY` drive
   - You should see `boot_out.txt` and `code.py` files
   - The `code.py` file is where your Happy Frog code will go

### Step 2: Install Required Libraries

1. **Download CircuitPython Library Bundle**
   - Go to [circuitpython.org/libraries](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)
   - Download the latest library bundle



2. **Extract and Copy Libraries**
   - Extract the downloaded bundle
   - Create a `lib` folder on your `CIRCUITPY` drive
   - Copy the following folders to `lib`:
     - `adafruit_hid`
     - `adafruit_hid.keyboard`
     - `adafruit_hid.keyboard_layout_us`
     - `adafruit_hid.keycode`

     *or you can copy the entire lib folder and paste/replace the one already there.*

3. **Verify Library Installation**
   - Your `CIRCUITPY` drive should now have:
     ```
     CIRCUITPY/
     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/
     ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ adafruit_hid/
     ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ adafruit_hid.keyboard/
     ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ adafruit_hid.keyboard_layout_us/
     ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ adafruit_hid.keycode/
     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ boot_out.txt
     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ code.py
     ```

### Step 3: Test Basic Functionality

1. **Create a Test Script**
   Create a file called `test.py` on your `CIRCUITPY` drive:

   ```python
   import time
   import usb_hid
   from adafruit_hid.keyboard import Keyboard
   from adafruit_hid.keyboard_layout_us import KeyboardLayoutUS
   from adafruit_hid.keycode import Keycode

   # Initialize HID devices
   keyboard = Keyboard(usb_hid.devices)
   keyboard_layout = KeyboardLayoutUS(keyboard)

   def main():
       print("Testing HID functionality...")
       time.sleep(2)
       
       # Type a test message
       keyboard_layout.write("HID Test - Hello World!")
       time.sleep(0.5)
       
       # Press Enter
       keyboard.press(Keycode.ENTER)
       keyboard.release(Keycode.ENTER)
       
       print("Test completed!")

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       main()
   ```

2. **Rename and Test**
   - Rename `test.py` to `code.py`
   - The device will automatically run the code
   - Connect to a test computer and observe the output

   ***IMPORTANT!!! whatever code you put into code.py WILL AUTOMATICALLY RUN THE INSTANT YOU DO THIS in ATTACKMODE*** please know what you are writing, I am not responsible if you freakin dox yourself or you give your pc a cold. To avoid anything from auto running on your device, you can:

##  Testing Method Options 

### Option 1: Virtual Machine (Recommended)
**The Safest Approach:**
- **VM Software**: Use VirtualBox, VMware, or Hyper-V
- **Isolated Environment**: No access to host system or network
- **Snapshot Before Testing**: Create restore points
- **Disconnect Network**: Remove network adapters during testing
- **Test OS**: Use Windows 10/11 VM or Linux VM

**VM Setup Steps:**
1. Install VirtualBox/VMware
2. Create new VM with Windows 10/11
3. Disable network adapters
4. Take snapshot before testing
5. Connect your microcontroller
6. Test your payload
7. Restore snapshot after testing

### Option 2: Dedicated Test Machine 
*This is what I use, and that laptop has been wiped and flashed, with multiple OS, a hundred times in the process*
**Physical Isolation:**
- **Old Laptop**: Use a spare/old computer
- **No Important Data**: Wipe and reinstall OS
- **No Network**: Disconnect WiFi/Ethernet
- **No Personal Accounts**: Use test accounts only
- **Fresh Install**: Clean OS installation

### Option 3: Live USB/DVD
**Temporary Environment:**
- **Linux Live USB**: Ubuntu, Kali Linux, or Tails
- **No Installation**: Runs from USB without affecting system
- **Temporary**: No permanent changes
- **Isolated**: Separate from main OS

### Option 4: Sandboxed Environment
**Advanced Isolation:**
- **Windows Sandbox**: Built-in Windows feature
- **Docker Containers**: For Linux-based testing
- **Application Sandboxing**: Tools like Sandboxie
- **Browser Isolation**: For web-based testing

## üîí Additional Safety Measures

### Before Testing
1. **Backup Everything**: Create system restore points
2. **Document Your Setup**: Keep notes of what you're testing
3. **Use Test Accounts**: Never use personal accounts
4. **Disconnect Networks**: Remove internet access
5. **Prepare Recovery**: Have recovery media ready

### During Testing
1. **Monitor Closely**: Watch for unexpected behavior
2. **Have Escape Plan**: Know how to stop execution
3. **Keep Logs**: Document what happens
4. **Stay Focused**: Don't multitask during testing
5. **Be Ready to Pull**: Keep device easily removable

### After Testing
1. **Restore Environment**: Return to clean state
2. **Review Logs**: Check what actually happened
3. **Clean Up**: Remove any test files/registry entries
4. **Document Results**: Keep notes for future reference
5. **Verify Safety**: Ensure no persistent changes
