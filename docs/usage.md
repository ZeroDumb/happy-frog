##  Hardware Setup

### Step-by-Step Microcontroller Setup

#### For Seeed Xiao RP2040 (Recommended)

1. **Download CircuitPython:**
   - Go to [circuitpython.org](https://circuitpython.org/)
   - Find "Seeed XIAO RP2040" in the board list
   - Download the `.uf2` file

2. **Enter bootloader mode:**
   - Connect your Xiao RP2040 via USB-C
   - **Double-tap the reset button** (small button on the board)
   - Your computer should show a new USB drive named `RPI-RP2`

3. **Install CircuitPython:**
   - Copy the downloaded `.uf2` file to the `RPI-RP2` drive
   - The device will restart automatically
   - You should now see a `CIRCUITPY` drive

4. **Install required libraries:**
   - Go to [circuitpython.org/libraries](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)
   - Download the latest library bundle
   - Extract the bundle
   - Create a `lib` folder on your `CIRCUITPY` drive
   - Copy these folders to `lib`:
     - `adafruit_hid`
     - `adafruit_hid.keyboard`
     - `adafruit_hid.keyboard_layout_us`
     - `adafruit_hid.keycode`

#### For Other Devices
- **Raspberry Pi Pico**: Follow same steps as Xiao RP2040 (same chip)
- **DigiSpark**: Requires Arduino IDE setup (see `docs/microcontrollers.md`)
- **Other devices**: See `docs/microcontrollers.md` for detailed instructions

### Testing Your Device

1. **Create a test script:**
   ```bash
   happy-frog copy-payload hello_world.txt ./test_script.txt
   ```

2. **Generate device code:**
   ```bash
   happy-frog encode test_script.txt -d xiao_rp2040 -o test_output.py
   ```

3. **Upload to device:**
   - Copy `test_output.py` to your `CIRCUITPY` drive as `code.py`
   - The device will automatically run the code

4. **Test:**
   - Connect to a test computer
   - Observe the automated input behavior
   - **Always test in controlled environments**

##  Safety and Best Practices

### Physical Security
- **Store devices securely** when not in use
- **Label your devices** clearly as educational tools
- **Keep inventory** of all your devices
- **Never leave devices** in public or unsecured areas

### Operational Security
- **Test only on systems you own** or have explicit permission
- **Use isolated test environments** when possible
- **Disconnect from networks** during testing
- **Monitor for unexpected behavior**

### Testing Environments

#### Option 1: Virtual Machine (Recommended)
- **VM Software**: Use VirtualBox, VMware, or Hyper-V
- **Isolated Environment**: No access to host system or network
- **Snapshot Before Testing**: Create restore points
- **Disconnect Network**: Remove network adapters during testing

#### Option 2: Dedicated Test Machine
- **Old Laptop**: Use a spare/old computer
- **No Important Data**: Wipe and reinstall OS
- **No Network**: Disconnect WiFi/Ethernet
- **No Personal Accounts**: Use test accounts only

#### Option 3: Live USB/DVD
- **Linux Live USB**: Ubuntu, Kali Linux, or Tails
- **No Installation**: Runs from USB without affecting system
- **Temporary**: No permanent changes

### Educational Best Practices
- **Document everything** you do
- **Get written permission** before testing on any system
- **Report vulnerabilities** responsibly if found
- **Share knowledge** with the cybersecurity community
