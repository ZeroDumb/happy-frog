# üê∏ Happy Frog

**Educational HID Emulation Framework for Cybersecurity Learning**

Happy Frog is an open-source educational framework that demonstrates HID (Human Interface Device) emulation techniques using microcontrollers. It provides a simple scripting language similar to Ducky Script but with our own naming conventions, to avoid any legal concerns, as well as **Happy Frog Exclusive features** that go beyond traditional HID emulation tools.
